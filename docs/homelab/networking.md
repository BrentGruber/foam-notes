* I would like to manage my homelab networking using [[wireguard]]
* This will allow me to create and maintain virtual networks.
* For example I could keep my hypervisors on a separate network than my app servers.
* I will probably start off using [[tailscale]] because it has a lot of additional helpful features, but I will need to pay attention to the free tier limits.
