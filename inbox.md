- Notes should be relatable by type #foam
- Tags should work like wiki links without having to have an actual doc to link them #foam
- Thinking about possibly having a web app that can clone the foam repo and create a note explorer online
- Would like an ios app that at least lets me write notes into the inbox easily
- Would be cool if I could figure out how to configure vs code to always open that as part of the workspace
- Need to create git ops controlled caddy server
- Tailscale has an inventory option and recently opened api
- levels.fyi for career information
